The Simpson 1/3 Method is a numerical integration technique used to approximate the definite integral of a function. The definite integral of a function f(x) between the limits a and b represents the area under the curve of the function within those limits.
This method is more accurate than the trapezoidal rule, which fits a straight line through every two consecutive points of the function.
