The trapezoidal rule is a numerical integration method that can be used to approximate the definite integral of a function.
To use the trapezoidal rule, we first divide the interval of integration into a number of smaller sub-intervals, or "steps." We then approximate the function by a straight line between the two endpoints of each sub-interval.
